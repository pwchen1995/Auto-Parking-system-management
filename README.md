# Auto-Parking-system-management
WSU spring 2021 Software Quality project

Our idea is to build a auto parking system. Beside common function like detecting car plate while entering or leaving garage, the system should provide reservation system along with online payment access. This is a model for software quality control and implementation.

* Ability to make a reservation 
* Ability to make a payment online
* Ability to contact customer service
* Ability to run the system automated

This repo serves as a model code for auto-parking system mangament for all of the CptS 583 project teams in Spring 2021.The app is presently set be served to http://localhost:8081 through the command npm run dev.
